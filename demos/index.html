        <h1>Alpaca Demos</h1>

        <p>
            This page provides a listing of pre-built demos for Alpaca.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="browser/quickstart">Quick Start (Browser)</a>
                <br/>
                An empty Alpaca project that you can use as a template for building your own forms ready-to-run in the browser.
                All of the Alpaca dependencies are loaded using SCRIPT tags.  Adjust the source code to fit your own schema,
                options and layout needs.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="browser/registration">Registration (Browser)</a>
                <br/>
                A sample registration form that uses a custom layout and custom validation messages.  The results of the form
                are posted to a server-side PHP file for capture into a database.  The storage into the DB is left as an
                exercise for the end user.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="browser/registration-bootstrap">Registration with Bootstrap (Browser)</a>
                <br/>
                The same sample registration form using Twitter Bootstrap for its user interface.  Twitter Bootstrap is a
                really nice and lightweight responsive UI framework.  Alpaca renders Twitter Bootstrap friendly forms
                for your end users.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
