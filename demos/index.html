                        <h1>Alpaca Demonstrations</h1>

                        <p>
                            This page provides a number of pre-built demonstrations of fully-constructed forms using Alpaca
                            with a combination of effective technologies including jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap, jQuery Mobile
                            and the Dojo Toolkit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Furthermore, these demonstrations are packaged along with the Alpaca release so that developers
                            can get a quick start on building their own forms.  In many cases, existing forms can simply be
                            taken and modified.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Developers</h2>

                        <p>
                            These demonstrations are located under the <code>/demos</code> directory that is shipped as a distribution.
                            You can also download the source from <a href="http://www.github.com/gitana/alpaca">GitHub</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you choose to download a distribution, everything is already set.  Just go to the <code>/demos</code>
                            directory and all of the files you need will be there.  Each demo is located in its own directory.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you've synced the code from GitHub, then please do the following:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Run <code>ant</code> to build Alpaca locally.</li>
                            <li>Navigate to the <code>/demos</code> directory and you will see a list of demos.</li>
                            <li>Within each demo folder, you can run <code>ant</code> to pull in local copies of all dependencies,
                            such as Twitter Bootstrap, jQuery and, of course, Alpaca itself.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            All of the dependencies will be pulled into a <code>lib</code> directory.  Once done, your Alpaca form
                            project will be entirely standalone.  You can copy the folder to anyplace you'd like such as a PHP server,
                            a NodeJS server or even right to your desktop.
                        </p>

                    <a name="browser"></a>
                    <div>
                        <h2>Browser Demonstrations</h2>
                        <p>
                            Alpaca runs right inside a browser running on the web or on a mobile device.  These projects
                            introduce Alpaca to a web site by simply including the <code>alpaca.css</code> and <code>alpaca.js</code>
                            files, respectively.
                        </p>

                                <br/>
                                An empty Alpaca project that you can use as a template for building your own forms ready-to-run in the browser.
                                All of the Alpaca dependencies are loaded using SCRIPT tags.  Adjust the source code to fit your own schema,
                                options and layout needs.
                            </li>

                                <br/>
                                A sample registration form that uses a custom layout and custom validation messages.  The results of the form
                                are posted to a server-side PHP file for capture into a database.  The storage into the DB is left as an
                                exercise for the end user.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <div>
                        <h2>AMD Demonstrations</h2>
                        <p>
                            Alpaca also comes packaged as an AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) file.  If you're building large
                            web application projects, we strongly suggest considering AMD as it helps to make dependency
                            management much easier.
                        </p>

                                An empty Alpaca project that you can use as a template for building your own forms.
                                All of the dependencies are loaded via require() and define() methods.
                                Adjust the source code to fit your own schema, options and layout needs.

                                A sample registration form that uses a custom layout and custom validation messages.  The results of the form

                        <p>
                            Alpaca natively renders into Twitter Bootstrap.  Bootstrap is a UI framework that provides
                            responsive design for your web sites.  It also provides convenient formatting for a number of
                            HTML elements.
