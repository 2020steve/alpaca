Feature: Validation of Input
  As a developer of a system using alpaca
  I want to be able to create rules for validation
  So that I can help the user input the correct data

  # Scenario: Length Validation
  #   Given I am on a page with an any field with a max length of 5
  #   Then I should see 1 "input" tag
  #   When I set the value of the first "input" tag to "Something longer than 5 characters"
  #     And after 1 second
  #   Then I should see 1 ".alpaca-invalid" tag
