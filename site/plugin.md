With Cloud CMS, you define your forms in the cloud and then surface them inside of your web pages using a simple
JavaScript snippet.  You paste the JavaScript snippet into your pages and then reload.  That's all there is to it.

Alpaca snippets work with most popular web HTML5 sites including Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla, PHP, .NET and other
web server technologies.
