## Cloud Hosting

Alpaca connects seamlessly to <a href="https://www.cloudcms.com" target="_blank">Cloud CMS</a> to load form information
(such as JSON schema, options and layout information) and then uses that to render right on your web site.  When
your customers complete the form, the form data is posted back to
<a href="https://www.cloudcms.com" target="_blank">Cloud CMS</a> and stored in a data list.  All of this data is
captured, including JSON fields and binary form attachments, allowing your team to query against it and generate
reports (such as PDF or CSV/Excel) at any time.

<a href="https://www.cloudcms.com" target="_blank">Cloud CMS</a> provides numerous subscription plans that are
both cost-effective and scalable for your organization's needs.

## Run on any Web Site

With Cloud CMS, you define your forms in the cloud and then surface them inside of your web pages using a simple
JavaScript snippet.  You paste the JavaScript snippet into your pages and then reload.  That's all there is to it.

Alpaca snippets work with most popular web HTML5 sites including Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla, PHP, .NET and other
web server technologies.
