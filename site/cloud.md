## Hosting

Alpaca connects to Cloud CMS to load forms and post data when your end user submits the form.  Cloud CMS captures
and stores all of the form information so that you can access it, view it and report on it in real-time.

## Run on any Web Site

With Cloud CMS, you define your forms in the cloud and then surface them inside of your web pages using a simple
JavaScript snippet.  You paste the JavaScript snippet into your pages and then reload.  That's all there is to it.

Alpaca snippets work with most popular web HTML5 sites including Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla, PHP, .NET and other
web server technologies.
