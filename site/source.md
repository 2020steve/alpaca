Alpaca is an open-source project and the source code is freely available.  It is licensed under the Apache 2 license
which affords everyone the opportunity to use, distribute and incorporate Alpaca into their products.  It's a
permissive license which lets you get the most out of Alpaca.

The goal with this project, the source code and all of the documentation is to provide the community with a really
great tool that can be used within various projects.  It is powerful but it's also intended to be extensible.
Our hope is that you'll have a great time with Alpaca and that it will improve your life.  With any luck, you'll build
something great and contribute back to the project by putting in new features, fixing bugs, contributing new language
packs and building cool and interesting new field controls.  And even if you don't, at least you'll have a better life
and think hot dog that was fun.

In being free and open-source, it's important to understand that Alpaca is supported by the community.  If you have
